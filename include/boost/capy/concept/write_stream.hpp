/** Concept for types that provide awaitable write operations.

    A type satisfies `WriteStream` if it provides a `write_some`
    member function template that accepts any @ref ConstBufferSequence
    and await-returns `(error_code, std::size_t)`.

    @tparam T The stream type.

    @par Syntactic Requirements

    @li `T` must provide a `write_some` member function template
        accepting any @ref ConstBufferSequence
    @li The return type of `write_some` must satisfy @ref IoAwaitable
    @li The awaitable's result must decompose to
        `(error_code,std::size_t)` via structured bindings

    @par Semantic Requirements

    Attempts to write up to `buffer_size( buffers )` bytes from
    the buffer sequence to the stream.

    If `buffer_size( buffers ) > 0`:

    @li If `!ec`, then `n >= 1 && n <= buffer_size( buffers )`.
        `n` bytes were written from the buffer sequence.
    @li If `ec`, then `n >= 0 && n <= buffer_size( buffers )`.
        `n` is the number of bytes written before the I/O
        condition arose.

    If `buffer_empty( buffers )` is `true`, `n` is 0. The empty
    buffer is not itself a cause for error, but `ec` may reflect
    the state of the stream.

    Buffers in the sequence are consumed in order.

    @par Error Reporting

    I/O conditions arising from the underlying I/O system (EOF,
    connection reset, broken pipe, etc.) are reported via the
    `error_code` component of the return value. Failures in the
    library wrapper itself (such as memory allocation failure)
    are reported via exceptions.

    @throws std::bad_alloc If coroutine frame allocation fails.

    @par Buffer Lifetime

    The caller must ensure that the memory referenced by `buffers`
    remains valid until the `co_await` expression returns.

    @par Conforming Signatures

    @code
    template< ConstBufferSequence Buffers >
    IoAwaitable auto write_some( Buffers buffers );
    @endcode

    @warning **Coroutine Buffer Lifetime**: When implementing coroutine
    member functions, prefer accepting buffer sequences **by value**
    rather than by reference. Buffer sequences passed by reference may
    become dangling if the caller's stack frame is destroyed before the
    coroutine completes. Passing by value ensures the buffer sequence
    is copied into the coroutine frame and remains valid across
    suspension points.

    @par Example

    @code
    template< WriteStream Stream >
    task<> write_all( Stream& s, char const* buf, std::size_t size )
    {
        std::size_t total = 0;
        while( total < size )
        {
            auto [ec, n] = co_await s.write_some(
                const_buffer( buf + total, size - total ) );
            total += n;
            if( ec )
                co_return;
        }
    }
    @endcode

    @see IoAwaitable, ConstBufferSequence, awaitable_decomposes_to
